  abstract  = {This extended abstract introduces CPN IDE, which replaces CPN Tools as a tool for editing and simulating (Coloured) Petri Net models. The main advantage of CPN IDE is that it is an extensible tool, which is needed to keep it running and to add new features which are of interest to the process mining community, like easily generating event logs.},
