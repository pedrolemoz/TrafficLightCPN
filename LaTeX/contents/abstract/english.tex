The article proposes a simplified approach to modeling a road intersection, focusing exclusively on the interaction between the four traffic lights present.
Using Colored Petri Nets as a modeling framework, the study seeks to provide a clear representation of the traffic control dynamics at the intersection.
By focusing on communication between traffic lights, the article seeks to simplify the understanding of the system, highlighting the essential aspects for a robust understanding of the flow of vehicles at the intersection.
This targeted approach aims to provide a solid foundation for future analysis and optimization, contributing to the development of more efficient and adaptable traffic control systems.
